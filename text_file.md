## Description Scripts

```text
✨ The world around you begins to twist and distort.
The ground vanishes beneath your feet, and a rush of wind pulls you into a swirling vortex of light and shadow...

A moment ago, you were in the real world. Now, you wake up in a strange, enchanted land where the sky shimmers with emerald hues
and the trees whisper in voices not their own.

A cloaked figure steps forward, their eyes glowing with an eerie light.
'You are not alone,' they say. 'Three of your friends have been taken—scattered across this world. If you wish to escape,
you must find them before time runs out. But beware… this land is alive, and it plays by its own rules.'

As their voice fades, you hear distant drums pounding like a heartbeat.
